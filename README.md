Thread pool is a mechanism allowing to complete several tasks concurrently within a single program. The pool 
contains some number of working threads waiting for a job to do. The usage of thread pool allows to avoid constant waiting for the thread to end during short concurrent tasks. It also enables user to depute a significant number of independent tasks.
